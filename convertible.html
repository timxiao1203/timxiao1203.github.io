			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			A company can raise capital in financial markets either by issuing equities, bonds, or hybrids (such as convertible bonds). From an investor’s 
			perspective, convertible bonds with embedded optionality offer certain benefits of both equities and bonds – like the former, they have the 
			potential for capital appreciation and like the latter, they offer interest income and safety of principal. The convertible bond market is of 
			primary global importance. 
			</font></p>							
			<br>
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998) argue that in practice one is usually uncertain as to whether the bond will be converted, and thus propose 
			dividing convertible bonds into two components: a bond part that is subject to credit risk and an equity part that is free of credit risk. 
			A simple description of this model and an easy numerical example in the context of a binomial tree can be found in Hull (2003).
 			</font></p>					
			<br>
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Grimwood and Hodges (2002) indicate that the Goldman Sachs model is incoherent because it assumes that bonds are susceptible to credit risk 
			but equities are not. Ayache et al (2003) conclude that the Tsiveriotis-Fernandes model is inherently unsatisfactory due to its unrealistic 
			assumption of stock prices being unaffected by bankruptcy. To correct this weakness, Davis and Lischka (1999), Andersen and Buffum (2004), 
			Bloomberg (2009), and Carr and Linetsky (2006) etc., propose a jump-diffusion model to explore defaultable stock price dynamics. They all 
			believe that under a risk-neutral measure the expected rate of return on a defaultable stock must be equal to the risk-free interest rate. 
			The jump-diffusion model characterizes the default time/jump directly.
 			</font></p>					
			<br>			

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			The jump-diffusion model was first introduced by Merton (1976) in the market risk context for modeling asset price behavior that incorporates 
			small day-to-day diffusive movements together with larger randomly occurring jumps. Over the last decade, people attempt to propagate the model 
			from the market risk domain to the credit risk arena. At the heart of the jump-diffusion models lies the assumption that the total expected rate 
			of return to the stockholders is equal to the risk-free interest rate under a risk-neutral measure.
 			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Although we agree that under a risk-neutral measure the market price of risk and risk preferences are irrelevant to asset pricing (Hull, 2003) 
			and thereby the expectation of a risk-free  asset grows at the risk-free interest rate, we are not convinced that the expected rate of return 
			on a defaultable asset must be also equal to the risk-free rate. We argue that unlike market risk, credit risk actually has a significant 
			impact on asset prices. This is why regulators, such as International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
			(BCBS), etc. require financial institutions to report a credit value adjustment (CVA) in addition to the risk-free mark-to-market (MTM) value 
			to reflect credit risk (Xiao, 2013). By definition, a CVA is the difference between the risk-free value and the risky value of an 
			asset/portfolio subject to credit risk. CVA implies that the risk-free value should not be equal to the risky value in the presence of default 
			risk. As a matter of fact, we will prove that the expected return of a defaultable asset under a risk-neutral measure actually grows at a risky 
			rate rather than the risk-free rate. This conclusion is very important for risky valuation.

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Because of their hybrid nature, convertible bonds attract different type of investors. Especially, convertible arbitrage hedge funds play 
			a dominant role in primary issues of convertible debt. In fact, it is believed that hedge funds purchase 70% to 80% of the convertible debt 
			offered in primary markets. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing (i.e., 
			the model prices are on average higher than the observed trading prices) (see Ammann et al (2003), Calamos (2011), Choi et al (2009), Loncarski 
			et al (2009), etc.). However, Agarwal et al (2007) and Batta et al (2007) argue that the excess returns from convertible arbitrage strategies 
			are not mainly due to underpricing, but rather partly due to illiquid. Calamos (2011) believes that arbitrageurs in general take advantage of 
			volatility. A higher volatility in the underlying equity translates into a higher value of the equity option and a lower conversion premium. 
			Multiple views reveal the complexity of convertible arbitrage, involving taking positions in the convertible bond and the underlying asset 
			that hedges certain risks but leaves managers exposed to other risks for which they reap a reward.

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			This article makes a theoretical and empirical contribution to the study of convertible bonds. In contrast to the above mentioned literature, 
			we present a model that is based on the probability distribution (or intensity) of a default jump (or a default time) rather than the default 
			jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible (see Duffie and Huang (1996), Jarrow and Protter (2004), etc). 
 			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			We model both equities and bonds as defaultable in a consistent way. When a firm goes bankrupt, the investors who take the least risk are 
			paid first. Secured creditors have the best chances of seeing the value of their initial investments come back to them. Bondholders have a 
			greater potential for recovering some their losses than stockholders who are last in line to be repaid and usually receive little, if anything. 
			The default proceedings provide a justification for our modeling assumptions: Different classes of securities issued by the same company 
			have the same default probability but different recovery rates. Given this model, we are able to back out the market prices.

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Valuation under our risky model can be solved by common numerical methods, such as, Monte Carlo simulation, tree/lattice approaches, or 
			partial differential equation (PDE) solutions. The PDE algorithm is elaborated in this paper, but of course the methodology can be easily 
			extended to tree/lattice or Monte Carlo.
 			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Using the model proposed, we conduct an empirical study of convertible bonds. We obtain a data set from FinPricing (2013). The data set 
			contains 164 convertible bonds and 2 years of daily market prices as well as associated interest rate curves, credit curves, stock prices, 
			implied Black-Scholes volatilities and recovery rates.
 			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			The most important parameter to be determined is the volatility input for valuation. A common approach in the market is to use the 
			at-the-money (ATM) implied Black-Scholes volatility to price convertible bonds. However, most liquid stock options have relatively short 
			maturates (rarely more than 8 years). As a result, some authors, such as Ammann et al (2003), Loncarski et al (2009), Zabolotnyuk et al (2010),
			have to make do with historical volatilities. Therefore, we segment the sample into two sets according to maturity: a short-maturity 
			class (0 ~ 8 years) and a long-maturity class (> 8 years). For the short-maturity class, we use the ATM implied Black-Scholes volatility 
			for valuation, whereas for the long-maturity class, we calculate the historical volatility as the annualized standard deviation of the daily 
			log returns of the last 2 years and then price the convertible bond based on this real-world volatility.
 			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			The empirical results show that the model prices fluctuate randomly around the market prices, indicating the model is quite accurate. Our 
			empirical evidence does not support a systematic underpricing hypothesis. A similar conclusion is reached by Ammann et al (2008) who use 
			a Monte-Carlo simulation approach. Moreover, market participants almost always calibrate their models to the observed market prices using 
			implied convertible volatilities. Therefore, underpricing may not be the main driver of profitability in convertible arbitrage. 
 			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			The empirical results show that the model priceIt is useful to examine the basics of the convertible arbitrage strategy. A typical convertible 
			bond arbitrage employs delta-neutral hedging, in which an arbitrageur buys a convertible bond and sells the underlying equity at the current 
			delta (see Choi et al (2009), Loncarski et al (2009), etc.). With delta neutral positions, the sign of Gamma is important. If Gamma is negative, 
			the portfolio profits so long as the underlying equity remains stable. If Gamma is positive, the portfolio will profit from large movements in 
			the stock price in either direction (Somanath, 2011).
 			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			We study the sensitivities of convertible bonds and find that convertible bonds have relatively large positive gammas, implying that 
			convertible arbitrage can make a profit on a large upside or downside movement in the underlying stock price. Since convertible bonds are 
			issued mainly by start-up or small companies (while more established firms rely on other means of financing), the chance of a large movement 
			in either direction is very likely. Even for very small movements in the underlying stock price, profits can still be generated from the yield 
			of the convertible bond and the interest rebate for the short position.
