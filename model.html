				<p>A model is proposed for quantifying daily returns and corresponding NAV changes of individual hedge 
				funds. NAV values of hedge funds are typically available on monthly basis. It estimates the daily NAV for a hedge fund 
				is based on modeling daily returns of the hedge fund as a weighted sum of returns of a combination of several market 
				indices and factors.</p>
				
				<p>These indices and factors typically include: a) US and international equity market indices; b) US 
				and international fixed income indices. c) Currencies; d) Other market factors, such as credit spreads, 
				volatilities, etc.</p>

				<p>A principal protected deposit note consists of zero plus call option and linear amortizing bond floor structure. 
				These models are essentially accrual models, determining the current value of the option due to fee accrual and 
				historical hedge fund performance </p>
				
				<p>They are not forward-looking, that is, the do not attempt to value the present value of future fee income, nor do 
				they attempt account for uncertainties in hedge fund redemption.</p>

				 <br>
				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Collateralized Swap</b></font>
				 
				 <p>The Collateralized swap structure is an option where the client, rather than making an upfront cash payment, 
				 puts up collateral instead–in this case in the form of a basket of hedge fund investments. For the most part the 
				 option acts as an equity swap, with the client paying the returns on a basket of hedge funds and receiving a 
				 spread over Libor, with the notional amount resetting periodically.</p>

				<p>The value of the collateral affects the current leverage ratio and can trigger re-/de-leveraging or redemption, 
				but otherwise has no affect on the option valuation itself. Nevertheless, to monitor the leverage ratio daily the 
				collateral needs to be MTM daily, and ultimately the dealer’s risk in a situation where the deal must be closed out 
				depends on the closeout value of the collateral.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hedge Fund Barrier Option</b></font>
				 
				 <p>A hedge fund barrier call option is a note whose payoff is based on a basket of hedge funds. The deals are 
				 structured so that once the barrier (usually set at 95% of the notional) is hit, the funds in the basket are sold 
				 off, with the realized fund value depending on the redemption period of each fund.</p>

				<p>The difference between the redeemed value of the basket of funds and the strike price of the call (usually set
				at 75% of the notional) is forwarded to the investor. When the redeemed basket value falls below the strike price 
				the investor loses money on the deal.</p>

				 <p>Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) model has a significant amount of parameter/model risk In particular, there are 
				 many input parameters (many of them market variables) and functions of these parameters that can have add a significant 
				 amount of risk.</p>
				 
				 <p>The prepayment model used for these instruments is a four-factor model. While the parameters and factors used were
				 supplied to us, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the parameters since it is a based on extensive statistical 
				 analysis of historical data.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hedge Fund Index</b></font>
				 
				 <p>Hedge fund index is unusual in the sense that it is tracking an asset class with reduced liquidity (hedge funds), 
				 and the performance of the index tracks the actual processes involved in hedge fund investing–in particular the 
				 timing of fund redemptions.</p>

				<p>So rather then being a weighted sum over some easily replicable market indices which is re-balanced periodically, 
				this index is run more like a quantitative fund-of-funds. This will allow investors to directly hedge its exposure to 
				index-linked products, which is important given that hedge funds are an asset class with reduced transparency, and with 
				returns and have traditionally been difficult to replicate using liquid instruments.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Canada Housing Trust Swap</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The Canada Housing Trust Swap includes variable rate mortgages and involves reinvestments made by the principal 
				 payments. The variable rate mortgages that appear in the deal are a result of these reinvestment. The model was in 
				 the context of the much more complicated problem where the notional on the mortgages was not fixed, and reinvestments 
				 were made at prevailing market prices.</p>

				<p>The issue of valuation is very much simplified by the fact that these variable rate mortgage principals pay interest 
				based on one month BA, and this rate resets monthly. The prepayment is not an issue with these mortgages, since the 
				principal is replaced (at par) in the event of prepayment and the floating rate payments remain one month BA. Therefore, 
				valuing these assets is a simple exercise of valuing them equivalent to a floating rate bond.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Foreign Currency Assets Hedge Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The foreign currency assets hedge model is employed to conduct the hedge effectiveness test for the foreign 
				 currency denominated floating rate LIBOR assets using CAD funding. The hedging derivative is a cross currency 
				 interest rate swap. The hedging is designated as the Cash Flow Hedging in which both interest rate risk and foreign 
				 exchange risk are hedged.</p>

				<p>A hypothetical cross currency interest rate swap (XCIRS), with the floating leg terms matching the critical terms 
				of the hedged FC floating rate assets, is used as the proxy measure. The actual hedging derivative is another XCIRS. 
				Specifically, the trade, upon which the model is intended to target, is substituted by a cross currency swap, which 
				is hedged by another XCIRS.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cash Flow Hedge Effectiveness</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A cash-flow hedge is defined as “hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is 
				 attributable to a particular risk. That exposure may be associated with an existing recognized asset or liability 
				 (such as all or certain future interest payments on variable-rate debt) or a forecasted transaction (such as a 
				 forecasted purchase or sale).</p>

				<p>An entity can designate the variability of cashflows such as interest receipts or payments on variable-rate assets 
				or liabilities or a forecasted transaction as the hedged item in a cashflow hedge.</p>

				 <br>
				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Fair Value Hedge Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes (that are attributable to a particular risk) in the fair 
				 value of a recognized asset, liability, or unrecognized firm commitment. Changes in fair value of derivatives that 
				 do not meet the criteria of one of these three categories of hedges are included in income.</p>

				<p>When hedging exposures associated with the price of an asset, liability, or firm commitment, the total gain or loss 
				on the derivative is recorded in earnings. In addition, the underlying exposure due to the risk being hedged must also 
				be marked-to-market to the extent of the change due to the risk being hedged; and these results flow through current 
				income as well. This treatment is called a fair value hedge.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Portfolio Acquisition Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The portfolio acquisition model is essentially a decision-making tool used to produce a bid that investors will 
				 make on an existing portfolio of loans. In this case, the loans are Home Equity Lines Of Credit (HELOC) (or ‘second 
				 mortgage’ because they are secured by the borrowers property, as is the ‘first mortgage’) typically with a maximum 
				 term of 15 years, with interest-only payments terminating in a final bullet payment. Borrowing is allowed up to the 
				 credit limit at any time at a variable rate tied to prime–can be fixed or floating–partial principal repayments are 
				 allowed, but not scheduled.</p>

				<p>Prior to modeling, the portfolio will have been carved up into reasonably homogeneous pieces–which the present 
				relatively simple model might be expected to represent fairly well. As part of this ‘risk screening’, the charge-off 
				rates are estimated from the credit quality (and other characteristics) of the loans in the portfolio. How well this 
				is done will affect the results produced by the model–this process will not be examined here.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>MBS Deferred Asset Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The MBS Deferred Asset model is used for fair value assets that have been transferred to the Canada Housing 
				 Trust (CHT) through participation in the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. In particular, the model calculates 
				 the fair value of the retained interest of the MBS.</p>

				<p>The model is a simple static cash flows model for the underlying MBS. The simplicity is possible due to the 
				assumption that the prepayments of the underlying pool are not dependent on changes in interest rates. Generally, 
				prepayments do depend on interest rates, and this is particularly true for US mortgages.</p>

				 <p>The mortgage Commitment model is being used to measure the risk of mortgage commitments. The model is actually

				 these mortgage commitments.</p>

				<p>In the first stage, the actual mortgage commitment pipeline is “mapped” to a simplified portfolio of European 
				swaptions. In the second stage, this simplified portfolio of swaptions is used to determine an appropriate portfolio 
				of swaps to hedge the swaptions.</p>

				 <p>Rate lock is a derivative on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages. Fallout functions are specified for various 
				 types of rate locks, and depend on several factors including source of rate lock and mortgage type. Like the prepayment 
				 models, these fallout functions are based on analysis of historical data and these have a significant impact on the 
				 risk measures of these rate locks.</p>

				<p>Rate locks are specified using various categories upon origination. Additionally, there is a current status that 
				may change daily during the course of the rate lock. Depending on the category and status of the rate lock, a fallout 
				function is applied. This fallout function is supposed to be a measure of how many of these loans will close at expiry. 
				Like the prepayment functions, these are based on historical observations.</p>

				 <p>Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) are essentially interest rate derivatives, this requires both a robust interest 
				 rate model as well as a model for the prepayment behavior. The prepayment model is dynamic, since prepayments (and 
				 ultimately MBS cash flows) depend very strongly on the dynamics of prevailing mortgage rates. These mortgage rate 
				 dynamics are driven by the dynamics of the yield curve.</p>

				<p>MBS cash flows depend very strongly on the prepayment assumptions of the underlying pools. The prepayments are both 
				substantial and heavily dependent on the prevailing mortgage rates. Hence, it is very important to use a reliable 
				prepayment model if one hopes to “accurately” capture the risk of these instruments.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>CMS Cap </b></font>	
				 
				 <p>CMS stands for constant maturity swap. A CMS cap/floor consist of a number of caplet/floorlet on the index rate of a CMS rate. Pricing a CMS cap/floor is equivalent to price a portfolio 
				 of a continuum of vanilla interest rate swaptions. The SABR model is applied to evaluate the replicating interest rate swaption portfolio.</p>
				 
				 <p>Thus, in some cases, this forward rate is not even well defined in the market, i.e., it has to be implied from a zero rate curve, which implies that it is also difficult to obtain the 
				 statistic correlation through historical data. This drawback makes the application of the method in a subjective way since a user may manipulate the result by changing the correlation.  </p>

				 <p>Quadratic Average Enhanced Curve Bootstrapping Algorithm (QAECBA) is intended to replace the existing Enhanced Curve Bootstrapping Algorithm (ECBA) and algorithm. The new approach 
				 achieves the ”smoothness” of both spot and forward zero-curves, and produces the instantaneous forward rate curve directly.</p>
				 
				 <p>Because the bootstrapping algorithms differ, we expect different sensitivities per instrument, but the portfolio’s total delta sensitivities should be close. Also, the sensitivities 
				 per instrument should have the same sign, implying hedge numbers having the same sign (positive for long positions, negative for short positions). </p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Money Market Basis Curve </b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A money market basis swap is an exchange of two floating rate notes referencing two different rate indices (indices can differ just by the length of underlying term, like USD 3 Month 
				 LIBOR versus USD 1 Month LIBOR, or by nature altogether, like USD 3 Month LIBOR versus USD 3 Month CD). </p>
				 
				 <p>Basis spreads can be applied to the indices (typically, to just one of them, the other being considered the reference index). The principals of the notes are denominated in the same 
				 currency (in our example, USD). Principals may be paid/received at maturity, or not (this last case is typical for money market basis swaps). (This contrasts with cross-currency basis 
				 swap situation where principals do change hands both at the effective date and maturity date, with principals related by a fixed contractual FX rate.</p>

				 <p>Municipal Bond Options are European-style vanilla options on coupon bonds. The Municipal Bond Option Pricing Model is used for daily calculations of P&L and risk numbers. These options 
				 are of vanilla European type. Black’s model (Black-76 model) is applied in the bond option pricing model. The discount curve is composed of a set of short tern rates, LIBORs up to two years 
				 and a set of medium to long term (2 years – 30 years) AAA yields with linear interpolation. </p>
				 
				 <p>Bond yield volatilities consist of one month (30 days) and one year (252 days) volatilities for a sequence of bond maturities with two dimensional linear interpolation. All those parameters 
				 are market observable. In application of Black’s model to price bond option, an option tenor should be much shorter than the term of an underlying bond.</p>

				 <p>Black’s vanilla option pricing model can be applied to pricing a variety of instruments including caps/floors, European swaptions, bond options, bond futures options and IR futures options. 
				 In the case of caps/floors and European swaptions1, X is the forward term rate and forward swap rate, respectively. For European bond options, the rate X represents the bond price. For European 
				 bond futures options and European IR futures options, X stands for bond futures price and Euro-Dollar futures price, respectively.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>SABR Calibration</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>Handling these market skews and smiles correctly is important to fixed income desks. Local volatility models have been used to manage these skews and smiles. Although local volatility 
				 models are self-consistent, arbitrage-free and can be calibrated to match observed market skews and smiles, it has been observed that the dynamic behaviour of smiles and skews predicted 
				 by local volatility models contradicts the one observed in the marketplace. </p>
				 
				 <p>In reality, options with different strikes require different volatilities to match their market prices. This is the market skew and smile. Usually, with respect to the strike, the word 
				 skew is for the slope of volatility and smile is for its curvature. The inherent contradiction of using different volatilities for different strikes in Black’s model makes it difficult 
				 to rigorously handle skew/smile risks.</p>

				 <p>This article presents a pricing model for skewed European interest rate digital option. The traditional pricing model is under the Black-Scholes framework. The new skew-adjusted model 
				 replicates a digital option by a portfolio of vanilla call options, and/or zero-coupon bonds and/or floating rate notes (FRNs). The new model provides a better approach to pricing skewed 
				 European interest rate digital options.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Short Term Curve </b></font>	
				 
				 <p>Short term curve construction may contain both regular and serial futures contracts that results in a significant amount of underlying term overlapping. The overlapping may lead to 
				 widely oscillating Partial Differential Hedge (PDH) numbers.</p>
				 
				 <p>Once we independently apply the above procedure for each of the three mod groups, we end up with three series of discount factors at three disjoint series of offset dates. We also have 
				 the discount factors at the cash dates. We form the final set of curve anchor dates from all offset dates and all cash dates. So, we obtain discount factors at all anchor dates. At any 
				 intermediate date we produce a discount factor by interpolating between the discount factors at the nearest (left and right) neighboring anchor dates.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>LGM Calibration </b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The Gaussian HJM interest rate (IR) term structure model, also called the Linear Gaussian Model (LGM), is used to pricing some IR structured products. To keep it being consistent with 
				 the IR option market, the model needs to be calibrated to the IR European swaption market.</p>
				 
				 <p>The traditional calibration routine in the model works only in a domestic market, in other words, it is not applicable to cases with funding in a foreign currency. The new calibration 
				 routine corrects the old one in LGM European swaption price calculation when a basis spread adjusted zero curve is applied for a non-reference currency..</p>
