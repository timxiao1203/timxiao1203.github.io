				<p>A model is proposed for quantifying daily returns and corresponding NAV changes of individual hedge 
				funds. NAV values of hedge funds are typically available on monthly basis. It estimates the daily NAV for a hedge fund 
				is based on modeling daily returns of the hedge fund as a weighted sum of returns of a combination of several market 
				indices and factors.</p>
				
				<p>These indices and factors typically include: a) US and international equity market indices; b) US 
				and international fixed income indices. c) Currencies; d) Other market factors, such as credit spreads, 
				volatilities, etc.</p>

				<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Principal Protected Note</b></font>
				
				<p>A principal protected deposit note consists of zero plus call option and linear amortizing bond floor structure. 
				These models are essentially accrual models, determining the current value of the option due to fee accrual and 
				historical hedge fund performance </p>
				
				<p>They are not forward-looking, that is, the do not attempt to value the present value of future fee income, nor do 
				they attempt account for uncertainties in hedge fund redemption.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Collateralized Swap</b></font>
				 
				 <p>The Collateralized swap structure is an option where the client, rather than making an upfront cash payment, 
				 puts up collateral instead–in this case in the form of a basket of hedge fund investments. For the most part the 
				 option acts as an equity swap, with the client paying the returns on a basket of hedge funds and receiving a 
				 spread over Libor, with the notional amount resetting periodically.</p>

				<p>The value of the collateral affects the current leverage ratio and can trigger re-/de-leveraging or redemption, 
				but otherwise has no affect on the option valuation itself. Nevertheless, to monitor the leverage ratio daily the 
				collateral needs to be MTM daily, and ultimately the dealer’s risk in a situation where the deal must be closed out 
				depends on the closeout value of the collateral.</p>

				<p>A model is presented to determine the value at risk (VaR) due to hedge fund volatility during closeout of hedge 
				fund positions, as well as pricing calculations for options written on a basket of funds. It contains the implemented 
				VaR calculations for options written on a basket of hedge funds, with minor changes and the methodology for calculating 
				the VaR of the LTV (loan to value) ratio for loans to funds-of-funds.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hedge Fund Barrier Option</b></font>
				 
				 <p>A hedge fund barrier call option is a note whose payoff is based on a basket of hedge funds. The deals are 
				 structured so that once the barrier (usually set at 95% of the notional) is hit, the funds in the basket are sold 
				 off, with the realized fund value depending on the redemption period of each fund.</p>

				<p>The difference between the redeemed value of the basket of funds and the strike price of the call (usually set
				at 75% of the notional) is forwarded to the investor. When the redeemed basket value falls below the strike price 
				the investor loses money on the deal.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Adjustable Rate Mortgages</b></font>
				 
				 <p>Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) model has a significant amount of parameter/model risk In particular, there are 
				 many input parameters (many of them market variables) and functions of these parameters that can have add a significant 
				 amount of risk.</p>
				 
				 <p>The prepayment model used for these instruments is a four-factor model. While the parameters and factors used were
				 supplied to us, it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the parameters since it is a based on extensive statistical 
				 analysis of historical data.</p>

				 <br>
				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hedge Fund Index</b></font>
				 
				 <p>Hedge fund index is unusual in the sense that it is tracking an asset class with reduced liquidity (hedge funds), 
				 and the performance of the index tracks the actual processes involved in hedge fund investing–in particular the 
				 timing of fund redemptions.</p>

				<p>So rather then being a weighted sum over some easily replicable market indices which is re-balanced periodically, 
				this index is run more like a quantitative fund-of-funds. This will allow investors to directly hedge its exposure to 
				index-linked products, which is important given that hedge funds are an asset class with reduced transparency, and with 
				returns and have traditionally been difficult to replicate using liquid instruments.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Canada Housing Trust Swap</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The Canada Housing Trust Swap includes variable rate mortgages and involves reinvestments made by the principal 
				 payments. The variable rate mortgages that appear in the deal are a result of these reinvestment. The model was in 
				 the context of the much more complicated problem where the notional on the mortgages was not fixed, and reinvestments 
				 were made at prevailing market prices.</p>

				<p>The issue of valuation is very much simplified by the fact that these variable rate mortgage principals pay interest 
				based on one month BA, and this rate resets monthly. The prepayment is not an issue with these mortgages, since the 
				principal is replaced (at par) in the event of prepayment and the floating rate payments remain one month BA. Therefore, 
				valuing these assets is a simple exercise of valuing them equivalent to a floating rate bond.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Foreign Currency Assets Hedge Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The foreign currency assets hedge model is employed to conduct the hedge effectiveness test for the foreign 
				 currency denominated floating rate LIBOR assets using CAD funding. The hedging derivative is a cross currency 
				 interest rate swap. The hedging is designated as the Cash Flow Hedging in which both interest rate risk and foreign 
				 exchange risk are hedged.</p>

				<p>A hypothetical cross currency interest rate swap (XCIRS), with the floating leg terms matching the critical terms 
				of the hedged FC floating rate assets, is used as the proxy measure. The actual hedging derivative is another XCIRS. 
				Specifically, the trade, upon which the model is intended to target, is substituted by a cross currency swap, which 
				is hedged by another XCIRS.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Cash Flow Hedge Effectiveness</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A cash-flow hedge is defined as “hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is 
				 attributable to a particular risk. That exposure may be associated with an existing recognized asset or liability 
				 (such as all or certain future interest payments on variable-rate debt) or a forecasted transaction (such as a 
				 forecasted purchase or sale).</p>

				<p>An entity can designate the variability of cashflows such as interest receipts or payments on variable-rate assets 
				or liabilities or a forecasted transaction as the hedged item in a cashflow hedge.</p>

				 <br>
				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Fair Value Hedge Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes (that are attributable to a particular risk) in the fair 
				 value of a recognized asset, liability, or unrecognized firm commitment. Changes in fair value of derivatives that 
				 do not meet the criteria of one of these three categories of hedges are included in income.</p>

				<p>When hedging exposures associated with the price of an asset, liability, or firm commitment, the total gain or loss 
				on the derivative is recorded in earnings. In addition, the underlying exposure due to the risk being hedged must also 
				be marked-to-market to the extent of the change due to the risk being hedged; and these results flow through current 
				income as well. This treatment is called a fair value hedge.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Portfolio Acquisition Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The portfolio acquisition model is essentially a decision-making tool used to produce a bid that investors will 
				 make on an existing portfolio of loans. In this case, the loans are Home Equity Lines Of Credit (HELOC) (or ‘second 
				 mortgage’ because they are secured by the borrowers property, as is the ‘first mortgage’) typically with a maximum 
				 term of 15 years, with interest-only payments terminating in a final bullet payment. Borrowing is allowed up to the 
				 credit limit at any time at a variable rate tied to prime–can be fixed or floating–partial principal repayments are 
				 allowed, but not scheduled.</p>

				<p>Prior to modeling, the portfolio will have been carved up into reasonably homogeneous pieces–which the present 
				relatively simple model might be expected to represent fairly well. As part of this ‘risk screening’, the charge-off 
				rates are estimated from the credit quality (and other characteristics) of the loans in the portfolio. How well this 
				is done will affect the results produced by the model–this process will not be examined here.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>MBS Deferred Asset Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>The MBS Deferred Asset model is used for fair value assets that have been transferred to the Canada Housing 
				 Trust (CHT) through participation in the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. In particular, the model calculates 
				 the fair value of the retained interest of the MBS.</p>

				<p>The model is a simple static cash flows model for the underlying MBS. The simplicity is possible due to the 
				assumption that the prepayments of the underlying pool are not dependent on changes in interest rates. Generally, 
				prepayments do depend on interest rates, and this is particularly true for US mortgages.</p>

				 <p>The mortgage Commitment model is being used to measure the risk of mortgage commitments. The model is actually

				 these mortgage commitments.</p>

				<p>In the first stage, the actual mortgage commitment pipeline is “mapped” to a simplified portfolio of European 
				swaptions. In the second stage, this simplified portfolio of swaptions is used to determine an appropriate portfolio 
				of swaps to hedge the swaptions.</p>

				 <p>Rate lock is a derivative on fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages. Fallout functions are specified for various

				 models, these fallout functions are based on analysis of historical data and these have a significant impact on the 
				 risk measures of these rate locks.</p>

				<p>Rate locks are specified using various categories upon origination. Additionally, there is a current status that 
				may change daily during the course of the rate lock. Depending on the category and status of the rate lock, a fallout 
				function is applied. This fallout function is supposed to be a measure of how many of these loans will close at expiry.

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>MBS Pass Through Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) are essentially interest rate derivatives, this requires both a robust interest 
				 rate model as well as a model for the prepayment behavior. The prepayment model is dynamic, since prepayments (and 
				 ultimately MBS cash flows) depend very strongly on the dynamics of prevailing mortgage rates. These mortgage rate 
				 dynamics are driven by the dynamics of the yield curve.</p>

				<p>MBS cash flows depend very strongly on the prepayment assumptions of the underlying pools. The prepayments are both 
				substantial and heavily dependent on the prevailing mortgage rates. Hence, it is very important to use a reliable 
				prepayment model if one hopes to “accurately” capture the risk of these instruments.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Callable Range Accrual Digital Adjustments Model</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A single factor linear Gaussian model (LGM) is proposed for pricing callable range accrual swaps (for both the 
				 fixed and floating coupon variants), and additional adjustments required to capture the implied volatility smile 
				 observed in the market. The single factor LGM is equivalent to a single factor Hull-White model.</p>

				<p>A range accrual swap is composed of two interest rate streams, a structured stream and a funding stream. The 
				funding stream is a set of standard floating cashflows paying LIBOR + a spread. The index for the floating cashflow 
				resets in advance and pays in arrear according to standard market conventions.</p>

				<p>On any contract payment date both the fixed and Libor coupon payments may cancel if the historical average BMA rate 
				observed during the coupon period is above (or below, as specified by the contract) the knockout strike. For example, 
				consider a contract where one party receives the fixed rate and pays 68% of 1M Libor. Both payments are cancelled if 
				on a coupon date the 1M average of the 1W observations of the BMA rate (i.e., the average of the prior 4 observations

				 <p>An arrear cap consists of caplets whose payoffs are not paid at the end of underlying index period. 
				 It belongs to the category of unconventional caplets/floorlets. A non-vanilla IR cap/floor is composed of a portfolio 
				 of unconventional IR caplets/floorlets. As before, it suffices to price an unconventional caplet/floorlet. However, 
				 the conventional Black’s formula may not be directly applied to price the unconventional caplet/floorlet. A so-called

				 <p>The value of a vanilla cap/floor is the sum of values of corresponding caplets/floorlets. The value 
				 of a conventional caplet/floorlet can be given by the well-known conventional Black’s formula1. Let

				 <p>The BMA Municipal Swap Index, produced by Municipal Market Data (MMD), is a single rate released every Wednesday

				 <p>A model is presented for pricing European/Bermudan type callable capped floating rate note (FRN) swaps. The capped 
				 FRN swap is a contract to swap cash-flows between a vanilla floating rate leg and a capped floating rate leg. The 
				 option gives the right to call the swap back in favor of the option owner.</p>

				<p>Pricing the capped FRN swap is relatively simple as the value can be expressed in a close-form analytical formula. 
				To price the option with Bermudan type, the capped FRN swap has been reduced to a contract to swap cash-flows between 
				a fixed leg and a caplet leg. To make the reduction valid, we need to assume that the date-setting in both legs of the 
				capped FRN swap are almost consistent.</p>
