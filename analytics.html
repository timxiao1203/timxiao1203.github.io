				<p>Payoff for equity GIC requires a dynamically created basket such that the weight factors incorporate 
				a division by the spot levels on the issue date, which converts the payoff to one based on a basket 
				of comparative returns (rather than basket returns). To automate feeds on a daily basis we will need 
				to create new baskets on a daily basis.</p>
				
				<p>The Pooling Criteria is the process of grouping like securities for the purpose of creating a 
				pseudo-GIC to efficiently hedge the total balance.  The new process will group a portion of the GICs, 
				greater than 3 million, into pools and leave the remaining GICs in Unallocated pools.  GICs exist 
				on four source systems; IPS (non-registered), RRSP (registered), RRIF (registered) and SIT 
				(registered and non-registered).</p>

				 <p>We review a model for computing the price, in the domestic currency, of European standard call 
				 and put options on an underlying foreign equity (stock or index) with tenor of up to 7 years. 
				 The function implements a local volatility based pricing method.</p>

				<p>Consider the calibration of the local volatility function based on market option prices or, 
				equivalently, market Black’s implied volatilities. If there exists a smooth surface of either 
				option price or implied volatility as a function of option strike and maturity, then this surface 
				uniquely determines the local volatility function.</p>

				<p>A model is presented for pricing European exercise, forward starting options on an underlying

				is specified by a list of n term and continuously compounded zero rate pairs and is intended for 
				use in computing forward equity values.</p>
				
				<p>In practice, option price or implied volatility surfaces are available at points on a relatively 
				sparse grid of strike and tenor pairs. Using analytical expressions to determine the local volatility 
				function then likely yields inaccurate results due to the numerical instability from calculating 
				first, and especially, second derivatives.</p>

				 <p>The owner of a convertible bond (CB) receives periodic coupon payments from the issuer, but

				 and put provisions, which respectively allow the issuer to buy back the convertible bond and 
				 the owner to put the convertible bond for respective preset amounts.  </p>

				<p>Here the short interest rate process is assumed to be of Ho-Lee form under the bond’s coupon 
				currency risk-neutral probability measure, and the stock price and foreign exchange rate processes 
				are assumed to follow geometric Brownian motion with drift under their respective risk-neutral 
				probability measures.  </p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Mutual Fund Securitization Study</b></font>
				 
				 <p>The purpose of the model is to determine, from a projected stream of future cashflows, whether 
				 all Commercial Paper used to fund the commissions to brokers for the sale of mutual funds will be 
				 repaid within a period.  Here a broker charges the Partnership a commission on the net asset value 
				 of the mutual funds sold.  The buyer of the mutual funds, however, pays nothing up front; instead, 
				 a deferred sales charge, which depends on when the mutual funds are redeemed, is assessed.</p>
				 
				 <p>The model assumes that the monthly net asset value of the mutual funds follows a deterministic 
				 process.  Administration and program fees, as well as mutual fund redemptions are then based on the 
				 monthly net asset value.  Issued Commercial Paper is amortized into equal monthly payments over 
				 a period of six years.  Here the cashflows generated from the administration and redemption fees 
				 are paid monthly to the Partnership, to be used for the payment of outstanding Commercial Paper 
				 and associated interest.  Furthermore, the model includes a test to determine whether a collateral 
				 infusion is required to aid in re-paying the Commercial Paper.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Hull-White Convertible Bond Study</b></font>
				 
				 <p>Here we assume that the short term interest rate process follows a stochastic differential 
				 equation (SDE) of the Hull-White form, and that the stock’s price follows geometric Brownian 
				 motion with drift.  For tractability, however, the stock’s price SDE is modified so that its 
				 drift does not depend on the stochastic short-term interest rate.</p>

				<p>Based on the Hull-White single-factor tree building approach, respective trinomial trees are 
				constructed for the short-term interest rate and stock’s price processes.  Using the Hull-White 
				two-factor tree building procedure, a combined tree is constructed by matching the mean, variance 
				and correlation corresponding to each combined tree node.  The convertible bond price is given 
				from the combined tree by backward induction.  </p>

				<p>Both the aggregate interest and the allocated collection amount depend on the remaining aggregate 
				(senior and subordinated) principal X. Each month during the liquidation period the aggregate principal 
				is reduced by the senior principal payment Z, unless it falls below a certain amount, which will

				 <p>The Black-Karasinski model is a short rate model that assumes the short-term interest rates to

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Variable Rate Swap Study</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>Variable rate swap is a special type of interest rate swap in which one leg of the swap corresponds 
				 to fixed rate payments while the other involves fixed rate payments for an initial period of time 
				 and a floating rate for the rest. The floating rate on that portion is defined as a minimum of two 
				 index rates.</p>

				<p>The two index rates are treated as assets whose values are lognormally distributed random variable. 
				Their pricing procedure uses discount factors retrieved from the EURIBOR curve.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>CMS Spread Option Study</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A constant maturity swap (CMS) spread option makes payments based on a bounded spread between 
				 two index rates (e.g., a GBP CMS rate and a EURO CMS rate).  The GBP CMS rate is calculated from 
				 a 15 year swap with semi-annual, upfront payments, while the EURO CMS rate is based on a 15 year 
				 swap with annual, upfront payments. </p>
				 
				 <p>We assume that both the forward GBP and EURO CMS rates follow geometric Brownian motion under 
				 their respective  -forward measures.  Here respective initial forward CMS rates are calculated.  
				 The forward rates are then convexity adjusted from respective parallel bonds specified</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Early Start Swap Study</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>An early start swap is a swap that has an American style option for the counterparty of starting 
				 the swap early, within a period of three month. Otherwise, the swaps are plain vanilla 
				 fixed-for-floating swaps.</p>

				<p>We consider a swap as an exchange of a principal for a coupon bearing bond with the same principal. 
				Indeed, from payer’s perspective, the swap’s present value is the difference between the present 
				values of received LIBOR payments</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Quanto Total Return LIBOR Swap Study</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A quanto total return Libor Swap is a swap where one leg is a regular floating leg paying LIBOR 
				 less a constant spread and the other leg makes a single payment at the swap’s maturity equal to a 
				 leveraged non-negative return on USD-for-EURO exchange rate paid in CAD. The main focus of the 
				 valuation model is the quantoed total return on the FX rate.</p>

				<p>The payoff of the leg based on the return of the foreign exchange rate is a payoff of a European 
				call option.  Its present value is given by Black’s formula for futures with the discounting factor 
				equal to the Canadian zero-coupon bond</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Daily Digital LIBOR Swap Study</b></font>	
				 
				 <p>A daily digital LIBOR swap is an interest rate swap whose reference interest rate is three-month 
				 USD Libor BBA. For each accrual period in the swap, one party receives the reference rate, and pays 
				 the reference rate plus a positive spread, but weighted by the ratio of the number of calendar days 
				 in the period that the reference rate sets below an upper level to the total number of calendar days 
				 in the period.</p>

				<p>The payoff amount can be viewed as the value of the sum of a series of daily Libor digital payoffs.  
				Here we assume that Libor rates are log-normally distributed, and derives an analytical formula for 
				the daily digital payoff.</p>
