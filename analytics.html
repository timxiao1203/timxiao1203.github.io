				<p>The equity GIC product has the property that strike levels are the closing index levels on date of 
				issue. The proposed specification for pooling employs pool idents with the same maturity, issue date, 
				and index levels.</p>
				
				<p>Payoff for equity GIC requires a dynamically created basket such that the weight factors incorporate 
				a division by the spot levels on the issue date, which converts the payoff to one based on a basket 
				of comparative returns (rather than basket returns). To automate feeds on a daily basis we will need 
				to create new baskets on a daily basis.</p>
				
				<p>The Pooling Criteria is the process of grouping like securities for the purpose of creating a 
				pseudo-GIC to efficiently hedge the total balance.  The new process will group a portion of the GICs, 
				greater than 3 million, into pools and leave the remaining GICs in Unallocated pools.  GICs exist 
				on four source systems; IPS (non-registered), RRSP (registered), RRIF (registered) and SIT 
				(registered and non-registered).</p>

				<p>Analytics for pricing quanto Himalayan options on equity is discussed, where the single best return 
				is locked in each fixing period. Specifically, we considered the impact of the quanto adjustment term 
				on calibration and the computation of option premium and hedge ratios</p>
				
				<p>Himalayan options are a form of European-style, path-dependent, exotic option on a basket of equity 
				underliers, in which intermediate returns on selected equities enter the payoff, while the equities 
				are subsequently removed from the basket. </p>
				
				<p>This definition is consistent with the one in the case of domestic equities, that is, in the 
				absence of a quanto adjustment. In the quanto case, the effect of the change in the quanto adjustment 
				resulting from a change in the volatility is ignored. </p>

				 <p>We review a model for computing the price, in the domestic currency, of European standard call 
				 and put options on an underlying foreign equity (stock or index) with tenor of up to 7 years. 
				 The function implements a local volatility based pricing method.</p>

				<p>Consider the calibration of the local volatility function based on market option prices or, 
				equivalently, market Black’s implied volatilities. If there exists a smooth surface of either 
				option price or implied volatility as a function of option strike and maturity, then this surface 
				uniquely determines the local volatility function.</p>

				 <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Forward Starting Option Study</b></font>	
				 
				<p>A model is presented for pricing European exercise, forward starting options on an underlying 
				equity. The valuation requires two interest rate curve inputs. One curve, called the “hedge curve”, 
				is specified by a list of n term and continuously compounded zero rate pairs and is intended for 
				use in computing forward equity values.</p>
				
				<p>In practice, option price or implied volatility surfaces are available at points on a relatively 
				sparse grid of strike and tenor pairs. Using analytical expressions to determine the local volatility 
				function then likely yields inaccurate results due to the numerical instability from calculating 
				first, and especially, second derivatives.</p>
				
				<p>A forward starting option is an option whose strike price is not fully determined until an 
				intermediate date before expiration. A model is used to compute option price, Delta, Gamma, 
				Hedge Rho, Discount Rho, Vega and Theta.</p>

				<p>Here the short interest rate process is assumed to be of Ho-Lee form under the bond’s coupon

				are assumed to follow geometric Brownian motion with drift under their respective risk-neutral

				 <p>The purpose of the model is to determine, from a projected stream of future cashflows, whether 
				 all Commercial Paper used to fund the commissions to brokers for the sale of mutual funds will be 
				 repaid within a period.  Here a broker charges the Partnership a commission on the net asset value 
				 of the mutual funds sold.  The buyer of the mutual funds, however, pays nothing up front; instead, 
				 a deferred sales charge, which depends on when the mutual funds are redeemed, is assessed.</p>
				 
				 <p>The model assumes that the monthly net asset value of the mutual funds follows a deterministic 
				 process.  Administration and program fees, as well as mutual fund redemptions are then based on the 
				 monthly net asset value.  Issued Commercial Paper is amortized into equal monthly payments over 
				 a period of six years.  Here the cashflows generated from the administration and redemption fees 
				 are paid monthly to the Partnership, to be used for the payment of outstanding Commercial Paper 
				 and associated interest.  Furthermore, the model includes a test to determine whether a collateral 
				 infusion is required to aid in re-paying the Commercial Paper.</p>
				 
				 <p>The net asset value of the mutual funds follows a deterministic process, and that one party's

				 <p>A convertible bond pays the holder periodic coupon payments from the issuer, but can also 
				 convert it into the issuer’s stock.  The model uses a two-factor trinomial tree for pricing 
				 the convertible bond.</p>
				 
				 <p>Here we assume that the short term interest rate process follows a stochastic differential 
				 equation (SDE) of the Hull-White form, and that the stock’s price follows geometric Brownian 
				 motion with drift.  For tractability, however, the stock’s price SDE is modified so that its 
				 drift does not depend on the stochastic short-term interest rate.</p>

				<p>Based on the Hull-White single-factor tree building approach, respective trinomial trees are 
				constructed for the short-term interest rate and stock’s price processes.  Using the Hull-White 
				two-factor tree building procedure, a combined tree is constructed by matching the mean, variance

				 <p>We consider a securitization deal, which allows the holder to purchase co-ownership interests in 
				 a revolving pool of credit card receivables. To fund the acquisition of the interests in the revolving 
				 pool, the trust issued Asset-Backed Notes, in a number of different series. A share of future

				 <p>An early amortization event is a set of circumstances specified in the offering memorandum, which

				 Generally, early amortization is triggered by the failure of the pool assets to remain within a certain 
				 range of value or quality.</p>

				<p>Both the aggregate interest and the allocated collection amount depend on the remaining aggregate 
				(senior and subordinated) principal X. Each month during the liquidation period the aggregate principal

				 <p>A flexible GIC is an investment with an embedded option to redeem the principal and accrued 
				 interest at any time after 30 days from the date of purchase. In other words, the holder of GIC 
				 has an option to redeem the principal and accrued interest at any time after 30 days of from the 
				 date of purchase. No interest is paid if the investment is redeemed within first 30 days from 
				 the purchase date.</p>
				 
				 <p>In the case of exercise a penalty is applied: the accrued interest is recalculated according 
				 to a lower rate than that set for the deal till maturity. The interest adjustments are typically 
				 different for the two exercise periods: the adjusted interest rate for the first exercise period 
				 is lower than that for the second one.</p>

				<p>We price the option of a flexible GIC with a one factor Hull-White model via a trinomial tree. 
				The Hull-White model assumes a normal distribution for the rates. Our solution constructs a Hull-White

				 <p>An important feature of the popular three factor trinomial tree is that it uses a deterministic 
				 approximation of the interest rates for constructing the stock tree. The preservation of the

				 a problem.</p>

				<p>We propose a three-factor tree model that implements the Hull-White and Black-Karasinski models. 
				The new tree model does preserve the martingale property of the stock for sufficiently long terms 
				(with accuracy better that 10-8 for terms of at least 10 years).  </p>
				
				<p>Given the limitations of the three-factor model that stem from the deterministic approximation 
				of the interest rates, it performs remarkably well. Even for a bond’s term as long as 7 years the 
				difference between the model and benchmark is within acceptable limits. The differences grow rapidly 
				for longer terms, and the model is not recommended for terms exceeding 7 years.</p>
