                Collateralization Examination</font></I></p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Collateralization is an essential element in the so-called plumbing of the financial system that is the Achilles' heel of global financial 
			markets. It allows financial institutions to reduce economic capital and credit risk, free up lines of credit, and expand the range of 
			counterparties. All of these factors contribute to the growth of financial markets. The benefits are broadly acknowledged and affect dealers 
			and end users, as well as the financial system generally. 		
			</font></p>							
			<br>
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			The reason collateralization of financial derivatives and repos has become one of the most important and widespread credit risk mitigation 
			techniques is that the Bankruptcy Code contains a series of “safe harbor” provisions to exempt these contracts from the “automatic stay”.
			The automatic stay prohibits the creditors from undertaking any act that threatens the debtor’s asset, while the safe harbor, a luxury, 
			permits the creditors to terminate derivative and repo contracts with the debtor in bankruptcy and to seize the underlying collateral. 
			This paper focuses on safe harbor contracts (e.g., derivatives and repos), but many of the points made are equally applicable to automatic 
			stay contracts.
			</font></p>					
			<br>
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Financial derivatives can be categorized into three types. The first category is over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, which are customized 
			bilateral agreements. The second group is cleared derivatives, which are negotiated bilaterally but booked with a clearinghouse. Finally, 
			the third type is exchange-traded/listed derivatives, which are executed over an exchange. The differences between the three types are 
			described in detail on the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) website (see ISDA (2013)).
			</font></p>					
			<br>			
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Under the new regulations (e.g., Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act), certain ‘eligible’ OTC derivatives must be cleared with central 
			counterparties (CCPs) (see Heller and Vause (2012), Pirrong (2011), etc.). Hull (2011) further recommends mandatory CCP clearing of all 
			OTC derivatives. Meanwhile, Duffie and Zhu (2011) suggest a move toward the joint clearing of interest rate swaps and credit default swaps 
			(CDS) in the same clearinghouse.
			</font></p>					
			<br>					
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			The posting of collateral is regulated by the Credit Support Annex (CSA). The CSA was originally designed for OTC derivatives, but more 
			recently has been updated for cleared/listed derivatives. For this reason people in the financial industry often refer to collateralized 
			contracts as CSA contracts and non-collateralized contracts as non-CSA contracts.
			</font></p>					
			<br>					

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			There are three types of collateralization: full, partial or over. Full-collateralization is a process where the posting of collateral 
			is equal to the current mark-to-market (MTM) value. Partial/under-collateralization is a process where the posting of collateral is less 
			than the current MTM value. Over-collateralization is a process where the posting of collateral is greater than the current MTM value.
			</font></p>					
			<br>		

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			From the perspective of collateral obligations, collateral arrangements can be unilateral or bilateral. In a unilateral arrangement, 
			only one predefined counterparty has the right to call for collateral. Unilateral agreements are generally used when the other counterparty 
			is much less creditworthy. In a bilateral arrangement, on the other hand, both counterparties have the right to call for collateral. 
			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Upon default and early termination, the values due under the ISDA Master Agreement are determined. These amounts are then netted and 
			a single net payment is made. All of the collateral on hand would be available to satisfy this total amount, up to the full value of 
			that collateral. In other words, the collateral to be posted is calculated on the basis of the aggregated value of the portfolio, 
			but not on the basis of any individual transaction.
			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			The use of collateral in financial markets has increased sharply over the past decade, yet analytical and empirical research on 
			collateralization is relatively sparse. The effect of collateralization on financial contracts is an understudied area. Collateral management 
			is often carried out in an ad-hoc manner, without reference to an analytical framework. Comparatively little research has been done to 
			analytically and empirically assess the economic significance and implications of collateralization. Such a quantitative and empirical analysis 
			is the primary contribution of this paper.
			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Due to the complexity of quantifying collateralization, previous studies seem to turn away from direct and detailed modeling of 
			collateralization (see Fuijii and Takahahsi (2012)). For example, Johannes and Sundaresan (2007), and Fuijii and Takahahsi (2012) 
			characterize collateralization via a cost-of-collateral instantaneous rate (or stochastic dividend or convenience yield). Piterbarg (2010) 
			regards collateral as a regular asset in a portfolio and uses the replication approach to price collateralized contracts. All of the previous 
			works focus on full-collateralization only.
			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			We obtain the CSA data from two investment banks. The data show that only 8.92% of CSA counterparties are subject to unilateral 
			collateralization, while the remaining 91.08% are bilaterally collateralized. The data also reveal that all contracts in OTC markets are 
			partially collateralized due to the mechanics of CSAs, which allow for the existence of limited unsecured exposures and set minimum transfer 
			amounts (MTAs), whereas all contracts in cleared/listed markets are over-collateralized as all CCPs/Exchanges require initial margins. 
			Therefore, full-collateralization does not exist in the real world . The reason for the popularity of full-collateralization is its 
			mathematical simplicity and tractability.
			</font></p>					
			<br>	

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			This article makes a theoretical and empirical contribution to the study of collateralization by addressing several essential questions 
			concerning the posting of collateral. First, how does collateralization affect expected asset prices? To answer this question, we develop 
			a comprehensive analytical framework for pricing financial contracts under different (partial/full/over and unilateral /bilateral) collateral 
			arrangements in different (OTC/cleared/listed) markets.
			</font></p>					
			<br>	
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			In contrast to other collateralization models in current literature, we characterize a collateral process directly based on the fundamental 
			principal and legal structure of the CSA agreement. A model is devised that allows for collateralization adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, 
			the model can back out differences in prices due to counterparty risk. This framework is very useful for valuing off-the-run or outstanding 
			financial contracts subject to credit risk and collateralization, where the price quotes are not available. Given this model, we are able to 
			explain credit-related spreads and provide an important tool for credit value adjustment (CVA).
			</font></p>					
			<br>				
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Our theoretical analysis shows that collateralization can always improve recovery and reduce credit risk. If a contract is over-collateralized 
			(e.g., a repo or cleared contract), its value is equal to the risk-free value. If a contract is partially collateralized (e.g., an OTC 
			derivatives), its CSA value is less than the risk-free value but greater than the non-CSA risky value.
			</font></p>					
			<br>						
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Second, how can the model be empirically verified? To achieve the verification goal, this paper empirically measures the effect of 
			collateralization on pricing and compares it with model-implied prices. This calls for data on financial contracts that have different 
			collateral arrangements but are similar otherwise. We use a unique interest rate swap contract data set from an investment bank for the 
			empirical study, as interest rate swaps collectively account for around two-thirds of both the notional and market value of all outstanding 
			derivatives.
			</font></p>					
			<br>						

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			ISDA mid-market swap rates quoted in the market are based on hypothetical counterparties of AA-rated quality or better. Dealers use this 
			market rate as a reference when quoting an actual swap rate to a client and make adjustments based on many factors, such as credit risk, 
			liquidity risk, funding cost, operational cost and expected profit, etc. Unlike most other studies, this study mainly concentrates the 
			analysis on swap adjustments/premia related to credit risk and collateralization, which are to be made to the mid-market swap rates for 
			real counterparties.
			</font></p>					
			<br>			

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Prior research has primarily focused on the generic mid-market swap rates and results appear puzzling. Sorensen and Bollier (1994) believe 
			that swap spreads (i.e., the difference between swap rates and par yields on similar maturity Treasuries) are partially determined by 
			counterparty default risk. Whereas Duffie and Huang (1996), Hentschel and Smith (1997), Minton (1997) and Grinblatt (2001) find weak or 
			no evidence of the impact of counterparty credit risk on swap spreads. Collin-Dufresne and Solnik (2001) and He (2001) further argue that 
			many credit enhancement devices, e.g., collateralization, have essentially rendered swap contracts risk-free. Meanwhile, Duffie and 
			Singleton (1997), and Liu, Longstaff and Mandell (2006) conclude that both credit and liquidity risks have an impact on swap spreads. 
			Moreover, Feldhütter and Lando (2008) find that the liquidity factor is the largest component of swap spreads. It seems that there is no 
			clear-cut answer yet regarding the relative contribution of the liquidity and credit factors. Maybe, the recently revealed LIBOR scandal 
			can partially explain these conflicting findings.
			</font></p>					
			<br>			

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Unlike the generic mid-market swap rates, swap premia are determined in a competitive market according to the basic principles of supply 
			and demand. A client who wants to enter a swap contract first contacts a number of swap dealers and asks for a swap rate. After comparing 
			all quotations, the client chooses the most competitive rate. A swap premium is supposed to cover operational, liquidity, funding, and credit 
			costs as well as a profit margin. If the premium is too low, the dealer may lose money. If the premium is too high, the dealer may lose the 
			competitive advantage.
			</font></p>					
			<br>		

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			To circumvent this difficulty, this article uses an indirect process to verify the model empirically. We define a swap premium spread as the 
			difference between the swap premia of two collateralized swap contracts that have exactly the same terms and conditions but are traded with 
			different counterparties under different collateral agreements. We reasonably believe that if two contracts are identical except counterparties, 
			the premium spread should reflect the difference between two counterparties’ unsecured credit risks only, as all other risks and costs are 
			identical. 
			</font></p>					
			<br>		

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Empirically, we find quite a number of CSA swap pairs in the data, where the two contracts in each pair have different counterparties but 
			are otherwise the same. The test results demonstrate that the model-implied swap premium spreads are very close to the market swap premium 
			spreads, indicating that the model is quite accurate. 
			</font></p>					
			<br>								

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Third, what are the effects of counterparty risk and collateralization, alone or combined, on swap premium spreads? We first study the marginal 
			impact of counterparty risk on spreads. CDS premia (the prices of insuring against a firm’s default) theoretically reflect the credit risk 
			of the firm. Presumably, differences in CDS premia should be largely attributable to differences in counterparty risk. We estimate a regression 
			model where market swap premium spreads are used as the dependent variable and differences between CDS premia as the explanatory variable. 
			The estimation results show that the adjusted   is 0.7472, implying that approximately 75% of market premium spreads can be explained by CDS 
			spreads. In other words, counterparty risk alone can provide a good but not overwhelming prediction on spreads. 
			</font></p>					
			<br>								
			
			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Next, we assess the joint effect of both counterparty risk and collateralization on premium spreads. Since the model-generated swap premium 
			spreads take into account both counterparty risk and collateralization, we present another regression model where the market swap premium 
			spreads are regressed on the implied swap premium spreads. The estimation results show that the constant term is insignificantly different 
			from zero; the slope coefficient is close to 1 and the adjusted   is very high. This suggests that the implied premium spreads explains nearly 
			all of the market premium spreads.
			</font></p>					
			<br>			

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Finally, how does collateralization impact pricing in different markets? Our proprietary data reveal that cleared swaps have dramatically 
			increased since 2011, reflecting the financial institutions’ compliance to regulatory requirements. We find evidence that the economical 
			determination of swap rates in cleared markets is the same as that in OTC markets, as all clearinghouses claim that cleared derivatives 
			would replicate OTC derivatives, and promise that transactions through the clearinghouses would be economically equivalent to similar 
			transactions handled in OTC markets. 
			</font></p>					
			<br>			

			<p class="subheader"><font color="#0000cc" size="3"  face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
			Although the practice recommended by CCPs is popular in the market, in which derivatives are continuously negotiated over-the-counter as 
			usual but cleared and settled through clearinghouses, some market participants cast doubt on CCPs’ economic equivalence claim. They find 
			that cleared contracts have actually significant differences when compared with OTC trades. Some firms even file legal action against the 
			learinghouses, and accuse them of fraudulently inducing the firms to enter into cleared derivatives on the premise the contracts would be 
			economically equivalent to OTC contracts (see Pengelly (2011)).
